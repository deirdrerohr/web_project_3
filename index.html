        Maine to Portland, Oregon we're going to take you on an exciting journey through some unknown regions of your
        country. Leave the car at home and travel by bike starting in New England where it all began. You will pass
        through 12 beautiful states, covering a total of 3,600 miles, and accomplish 3 monumental missions. Partying and
        taking a selfie with a famous rock star, donating $1 to a billionaire to help eradicate polio in Africa, and
        even stopping by famous author Stephen King's house to say hi and asking him to sign your favorite book.</p>

              and
              highly underrated state full of rich history and majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state you want
              to
              be sure not to miss. As your journey is going to be a long one, you had best be prepared for an arduous
              trek.

            <p class="place__paragraph">Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first European settlers on US
              territory in the era of Vikings, but is also home to L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a super
              sturdy backpack from for your 3-month expedition. </p>

              Hampshire.
              As serene and beautiful as it was in the 1700s, this state is still much less traveled than its neighbors
              to
              the South. So enjoy it while it lasts.
            </p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make sense to pick up
              some
              extra footwear? Fortunately for you, the best outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly
              hails
              from this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in Stratham, and pick up a pair of rugged,
              waterproof
              boots to keep your feet dry. Fi tting for unpredictable weather you may be confronted by while passing
              through
              the Appalachians. These boots are also better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent. </p>

              for going down in history. Since the late 1800s Schenectady, “The City that Lights and Hauls the World,”
              has
              been home to the world-famous General Electric Company.

            <p class="place__paragraph">This is where modern power generators were born as well as contemporary means of

              your
              bicycle to help you see through those dark lonely roads on your adventure. Such a light from GE will set

              from time to time, is another town worth passing through for several different reasons. While it might be
              most famously known as the scene of the Gettysburg address delivered by Mr. Lincoln during the Civil war,
              Pennsylvania also has produced a rather decent-sized Amish community (eerie, huh?)
            </p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">The reason we've brought you here today, if you haven't already guessed, can be
              summed up by using one delicious word: chocolate. Hershey's is a Pennsylvania-based company. Most likely,
              one of the tastiest missions you'll ever embark on during this tour, try to find an Amish friend and enjoy
              a bar in the National Wildlife Refuge on your way to Erie and have an extra eerie time! </p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">The current cost of a Hershey's Chocolate bar: about 60¢.</p>

              over 200 of which have registered with a magnitude of 2 or higher since 1776. However, earthquakes aren't
              the only thing shaking this centrally located state. One of the country's largest and oldest roller
              coaster parks is waiting to ROCK your world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be one of the most
              thrilling quests you'll ever complete (provided you can stomach it). Take a much-deserved break to ride as
